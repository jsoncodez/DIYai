# â€‹â€‹ Create own Model and DataSet App - Great for learning App (with GUI)

A desktop-based image classification app built using **TensorFlow**, **OpenCV**, and **Tkinter**. This user-friendly GUI tool allows you to create custom datasets, train models, and predict imagesâ€”all without writing code.

---

##  Features

- Create and manage image classes
- Upload and auto-rename images into categorized folders
- Train a CNN or pretrained model (e.g., MobileNetV2)
- Predict new images with class probabilities
- Correct misclassifications and add feedback to dataset
- Fine-tune the model
- Simple GUI via Tkinter for ease of use

## ðŸ’¡ Usage Tips

- Make sure each class has at least 10â€“20 images for decent results.
- Use clear, centered images for better model accuracy.
- You can correct a misclassified image after prediction, and the app will let you save it to the right class folder.
- For better performance, retrain the model occasionally with newly added images.
